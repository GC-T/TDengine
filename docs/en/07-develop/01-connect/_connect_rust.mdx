```rust title="Native Connection/REST Connection"
{{#include docs/examples/rust/nativeexample/examples/connect.rs}}
```

:::note
For Rust client library, the connection depends on the feature being used. If "rest" feature is enabled, then only the implementation for "rest" is compiled and packaged.
